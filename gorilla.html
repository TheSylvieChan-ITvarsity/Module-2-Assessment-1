                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The gorilla is the largest of the great apes. Gorillas are native to Africa. They have frequently been portrayed in fictional tales as ferocious creatures. In reality, however, gorillas are peaceful animals that subsist almost entirely on plant matter. Although they can appear intimidating when they encounter any outsiders, including humans, they are rarely aggressive.

                        Gorillas belong to the family Hominidae, which includes the other great apes—chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos—and humans. Together, humans, the great apes, and the lesser apes—gibbons—make up the superfamily Hominoidea. All of them, in turn, are classified in the mammalian order Primate. For some time, experts believed that gorillas were the closest living relatives to humans. However, studies of the DNA sequences of humans and the great apes have revealed that humans are more closely related to chimpanzees and bonobos.

                        Most authorities recognize two gorilla species—the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and the eastern gorilla (G. beringei). The western gorilla is further divided into two subspecies—the western lowland gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla) and the Cross River gorilla (G. gorilla diehli). The eastern gorilla is also divided into two subspecies—the eastern lowland, or Grauer’s, gorilla (G. beringei graueri) and the mountain gorilla (G. beringei beringei).
