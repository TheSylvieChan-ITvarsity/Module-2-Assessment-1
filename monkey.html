                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>
                        Monkeys are intelligent, social animals .They range from the tiny, playful marmosets of the Amazon rainforest to the cunning baboons of the African savanna. Most monkeys are arboreal (tree-dwelling) and active during the day. Monkeys share some physical similarities with apes (such as orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas) but have notable differences from them. Monkeys, for example, have a tail (even if only a tiny nub) and narrow chest. Apes are tailless and have a barrel chest.

                        Monkeys belong to the order Primates, which also includes the prosimians, apes, and humans. All monkeys are categorized as either Old World or New World monkeys. Old World monkeys are native to Africa and parts of Asia. New World monkeys are found in parts of South America and Central America. Although scientists differ in their opinions about some classifications for the families and subfamilies of monkeys, all classification schemes recognize the distinction between these two groups.
