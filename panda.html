                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can easily recognize the giant panda from its striking black-and-white coloring, round face, and smiling mouth. This mammal is a member of the order Carnivora (the carnivores, or meat eaters). Giant pandas are found in bamboo forests in the mountains of central China. Bamboo is a tall, fast-growing grass that is the main food of giant pandas. The giant panda is also commonly called panda bear. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca.

                        Like other bears, the giant panda has a bulky build and a short, stubby tail. It also has a round face with powerful jaw muscles. Adults are about 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) long from the tip of the nose to the rump and weigh about 165 to 250 pounds (75 to 115 kilograms) or more. The males are larger than the females. Giant pandas have a thick, woolly, white coat with black fur on the legs, shoulders, tail, and ears and around the eyes.

                        Giant pandas usually live alone. They are mainly ground dwellers but also climb trees. Giant pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are commonly observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust bathing (rolling in and covering themselves with dust or dry dirt). They can also swim.
