                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>
                        The warthog is a wild mammal of the grasslands and lightly forested areas of Africa. Warthogs belong to the family Suidae, which includes domestic pigs. The scientific name of the warthog is Phacochoerus aethiopicus.

                        Warthogs are brown-gray and stand about 30 inches (76 centimeters) tall at the shoulder. They are 35–60 inches (90–150 centimeters) long. A boar (male) can weigh 220 pounds (100 kilograms), whereas a sow (female) weighs about 150 pounds (70 kilograms). Warthogs have bristly hair that is generally sparse, but there is a mane that extends from the neck to the middle of the back. The tail is thin and is held straight up when the animal runs.

                        The head of a warthog is large in proportion to its body. The “warts” for which the animal is named are bumps that grow on the face of the male. Warthogs have two pairs of large teeth called tusks that grow outside the mouth. The lower tusks are sharp and straight. The upper tusks curl upward and are usually 8–12 inches (20–30 centimeters) long, but a very large boar (male) can have tusks as long as 24 inches (60 centimeters). Warthogs use their tusks to defend themselves, and boars also use them in fights.
