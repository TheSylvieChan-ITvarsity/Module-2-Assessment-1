                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Giraffes have a short body, but their legs and neck are very long. The coat is light brown with reddish brown spots. Many giraffes have two short horns between the ears. Giraffes have large nostrils and a good sense of smell. Their tongues are more than 18 inches (45 centimeters) long.

                        Giraffes are plant eaters. They can reach leaves at the top of trees. But they do not eat grass. It is very hard for them to reach the ground because the neck is stiff. To drink, a giraffe must spread its legs far apart to reach down.

                        Giraffes live in herds of up to 20 animals. They use their good eyesight to watch for danger. Lions are the giraffeâ€™s main enemy. Giraffes try to gallop away from enemies, but they will fight if necessary. They can run more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) an hour.

                        A female giraffe gives birth to one calf at a time. The newborn can usually follow its mother around within hours. Giraffes live about 20 to 25 years.

                        Giraffes are still common in eastern Africa. They are protected there inside national parks. In other places, however, hunting has reduced the number of giraffes.
