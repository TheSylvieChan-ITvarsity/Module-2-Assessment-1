                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>
                        Except for the tiger, the lion is the largest member of the cat family. Nicknamed the “king of beasts,” the lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. The males are easily recognized for their mane of fur around the head and neck. The lion’s scientific name is Panthera leo.

                        Historically, lions ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Now, however, they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated group of about 650 Asiatic lions lives under strict protection in India’s Gir National Park. Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland.

                        An adult male lion measures 6 – 7 feet (1.8 – 2.1 meters) long, not including the 3-foot (0.9-meter) tail. It stands about 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall at the shoulders. The male can weigh 370–500 pounds (170–230 kilograms). The female is smaller, shorter, and more slender. The female weighs only about 265–400 pounds (120–180 kilograms).
