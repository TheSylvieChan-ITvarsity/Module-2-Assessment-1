                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>
                        The largest of the cats is the tiger. It’s as strong and fierce as it is big. The tiger’s coat is often a bright golden color. It has black stripes on the head, body, limbs, and tail. The scientific name of the tiger is Panthera tigris.

                        The only continent that tigers are native to is Asia. They range from eastern Siberia, in Russia, through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

                        Tigers have adapted to a great variety of environments. Some reside on the Siberian taiga (subarctic forest), where it can be as cold as −40 °F (−40 °C) at night. Others inhabit mangrove swamps, where the temperatures reach more than 104 °F (40 °C). However, most tigers live in grasslands and rainforests because these habitats have the most prey.
