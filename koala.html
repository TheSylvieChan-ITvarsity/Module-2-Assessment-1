                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The koala varies in size depending on where it lives. It reaches about 24 to 33 inches (60 to 85 centimeters) in length and weighs up to 31 pounds (14 kilograms) in the southern part of its range. It is a bit shorter and weighs about half as much, however, in northern areas.
                        koala. The koala has a thick, woolly coat that is mostly gray or brownish. It has pale yellow or cream-colored fur on its neck, chest, abdomen, and the inside of its front limbs. There are also patches of lighter fur on its rump.

                        The koala has a stout body. Its broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small eyes, and big fluffy ears. The feet are strong and clawed. The two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable. This means that, like human thumbs, these digits can be placed against one or more of the other digits. This motion is useful for grasping objects.

                        Although koalas are sometimes called koala bears, they are not bears but marsupials—mammals known for carrying their young in an abdominal pouch. Koalas are native to Australia’s eastern and southeastern coasts. They feed almost exclusively on the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees. The koala’s scientific name is Phascolarctos cinereus.
